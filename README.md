AI\\Geospatial Engineer
-----------------------

I am an AI & Geospatial Engineer with a strong focus on applying artificial intelligence, computer vision, and advanced data processing to real-world geospatial problems. My work sits at the intersection of AI, GIS, and spatial analytics, where I design and build end-to-end systems that transform complex spatial data into actionable insights and usable products.

I have hands-on experience working with satellite imagery, orthophotos, point clouds, elevation models, and 3D geospatial data, and I specialize in building automated pipelines that handle the full lifecycle of spatial data from raw acquisition and preprocessing to modeling, analysis, visualization, and decision support. My technical approach emphasizes scalability, automation, and accuracy, particularly in domains such as terrain modeling, precision agriculture, object extraction, and spatial intelligence.

Currently, I am working as an AI/Geospatial Engineer Intern at FalconViz (KAUST), where I contribute to applied research and development in Geospatial Artificial Intelligence. In this role, I collaborate closely with researchers and engineers to translate domain-specific requirements into practical AI-driven geospatial solutions. My responsibilities include designing automated geospatial workflows, integrating machine learning models with GIS platforms, and developing AI-powered tools for spatial visualization and analysis.

My academic background includes a Bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Jordan, where I gained a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, data science, and intelligent systems design. The program was highly project-driven, giving me extensive experience in building real-world AI applications, working with real datasets, and applying theoretical concepts in practical, production-oriented contexts.
